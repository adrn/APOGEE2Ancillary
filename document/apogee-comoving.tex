He is an SDSS-III architect for his contributions to the
science archive server, data management software, and observation management
software used by the SDSS observers.

\section{Scientific and technical justification}

\subsection{Summary}

Our main science goal is to validate and obtain detailed chemical abundances for
a sample of high-confidence, candidate co-moving stars selected using parallaxes
and proper motions from the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS, a component
of the first data release of the Gaia mission).
We will use radial velocity measurements of each star in a candidate pair to
identify true co-moving pairs, which span a large range of physical separations
($\approx$0.01--10 pc).

... tracers of star-formation processes, are
sensitive to the tidal field and granularity of the Galactic mass distribution,
and will be valuable targets for anchoring stellar models across the HR diagram.

Wide binaries as dynamical tracers

Wide binaries as test-beds for stellar models

\section{Target Information}

We propose to observe 137 stars with $H>7$~mag within existing fields
from two categories:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 65 pairs (130 stars) for which both of the member stars falls
  within the existing fields
  \item 7 additional stars for which the other star in the pairs is aleady
  observed in APOGEE DR12
\end{itemize}
%
There are 21 pairs in the first category whose angular separation is smaller
than 72~arcseconds, the fiber collision threshold. However, given the
brightnesso f these stars, they should be able to reach signal-to-noise ratio
per resolution element over 100 with a single visit.
