\section*{External Collaborators: Requests for External Status}

Adrian M. Price-Whelan: An EC request will be submitted with this proposal.

Adrian M. Price-Whelan has expertise in statistical inference and dynamical
modeling of the Milky Way.

He is an SDSS-III architect for his contributions to the
science archive server, data management software, and observation management
software used by the SDSS observers.

\section{Scientific and technical justification}

\subsection{Summary}

Wide binaries as dynamical tracers

Wide binaries as test-beds for stellar models

Sample 1: Pairs with a red giant member - observe all of these

Sample 2: All other pairs
