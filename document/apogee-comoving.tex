\section{Scientific and technical justification}

\subsection{Summary}

Our main science goal is to validate and obtain detailed chemical abundances for
a sample of high-confidence, candidate co-moving stars selected using parallaxes
and proper motions from the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS, a component
of the first data release of the Gaia mission).
We will use radial velocity measurements of each star in a candidate pair to
identify true co-moving pairs, which span a large range of physical separations
($\approx$0.01--10 pc).

- Emphasize the support provided to APOGEE - the confirmed wide separation pairs
  provide tests relevant to the APOGEE pipeline and results. (test abundances,
  age indicators, prospects of chemical tagging)

... tracers of star-formation processes, are
sensitive to the tidal field and granularity of the Galactic mass distribution,
and will be valuable targets for anchoring stellar models across the HR diagram.

Wide binaries as dynamical tracers

Wide binaries as test-beds for stellar models

Sample 1: Pairs with a red giant member - observe all of these

Sample 2: All other pairs

Mention false-positive rate constraint from RAVE
